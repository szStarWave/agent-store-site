# Authentication

`xparse-cli` supports three explicit authentication paths while preserving the
legacy AppKey workflow. In an interactive terminal, bare `xparse-cli auth`
opens a menu for OAuth, AppKey, status, and logout. With piped/non-terminal
input it keeps the legacy AppKey prompt contract.

## Standalone Device OAuth

Use this in terminals and on servers without a callback listener. Inside the
interactive TTY auth menu, choosing OAuth selects Device OAuth for SSH or a
Linux session without `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. Non-TTY and CI automation
must call the explicit Device command; bare `auth` intentionally remains the
legacy AppKey input flow:

```bash
# Print URL/code and do not try to open a browser
xparse-cli auth device --open-browser=never

# Open verification_uri_complete when a desktop browser is available
xparse-cli auth device --open-browser=auto
```

`auto` and `never` run the same Device flow. Automatic browser opening is only a
convenience; authorization state remains on the server and the CLI continues
polling.

Client ID resolution is:

1. `--client-id`
2. `XPARSE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
3. `config.yaml` `oauth.client_id`
4. the shipped public xParse client `cli_textin_xparse`

The default client ID is public application identity, not a client secret. A
private deployment may override it with any of the first three options.

Scope resolution is flag, `XPARSE_OAUTH_SCOPE`, YAML, then `ocr:*`.

## Standalone Browser PKCE

Bare `xparse-cli auth` automatically chooses browser PKCE when a local GUI and
platform opener are available. Explicit commands always override detection:

```bash
xparse-cli auth browser
xparse-cli auth browser --prompt=consent
```

It opens Authorization Code + PKCE and listens only on the configured
`http://127.0.0.1` loopback callback. The default redirect uses port `0`, so
the operating system chooses an available ephemeral port; an explicitly
configured fixed port is still honored. `--prompt=consent` forces a fresh
authorization confirmation instead of reusing remembered consent.

Explicit `auth browser` fails fast in SSH/CI/headless mode and recommends
Device OAuth. `--open-browser=never` remains available for advanced explicit
port-forwarding setups.

## Standalone AppKey

The explicit legacy command remains compatible:

```bash
xparse-cli auth app-key
```

Bare `xparse-cli auth` only keeps the direct AppKey behavior for non-terminal
input; in a terminal it opens the authentication menu.

For automation, callers may provide a complete pair through
`XPARSE_APP_ID` and `XPARSE_SECRET_CODE`. Never print or copy the Secret into
agent output.

## Status and logout

```bash
xparse-cli auth status --output=json
xparse-cli auth logout --method oauth
xparse-cli auth logout --method app-key
xparse-cli auth logout --method all
```

Status is local and does not make a network request. An expired access token
with a still-usable refresh token remains logged in; the next paid OAuth parse
refreshes it. Logout attempts RFC 7009 remote revocation first (Refresh Token
preferred) and then removes the local token. A remote failure is a stderr
warning and does not prevent local logout. Logout does not delete remembered
consent; use the next browser login with `--prompt=consent` when a fresh
confirmation is required.

Omitting `--api` is equivalent to `--api auto`. Automatic mode queries current
quota and uses the daily free allowance first. It can use a reported
free-package allowance only when the quota request is AppKey-authenticated and
returns `free_package.free_remain_count`; Device OAuth status alone is not
package evidence. `--api free` forces the free endpoint only.
A successful login identifies the user and records the preferred authentication
method, but it is not approval to run `--api paid`. In paid mode, old
configuration files remain AppKey-first when both AppKey and OAuth exist, and
`--auth-method` temporarily overrides that paid-mode preference.
