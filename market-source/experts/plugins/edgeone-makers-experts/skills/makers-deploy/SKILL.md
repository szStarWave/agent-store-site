  This skill deploys frontend and full-stack projects to EdgeOne Makers (Tencent EdgeOne).
  Trigger this skill whenever deployment is part of the task — whether as the primary intent
  or a secondary step. Examples: "deploy my app", "publish this site", "push this live",
  "create a preview deployment", "deploy to EdgeOne", "ship to production",
  "go live", "release", "publish a new version", "redeploy",
  "上线", "发布", "发一版", "重新部署",
  "搭建并部署", "开发并上线", "build and deploy", "create and deploy".
  ⚠️ Also trigger when any agent is about to execute `edgeone makers deploy` or `edgeone makers deploy`
  commands — the skill contains critical rules for parsing deploy output and presenting access URLs.
  Do NOT trigger for post-deployment runtime errors (e.g. CORS issues, 500 errors after deploy) —
  route those to the skill owning the runtime: edgeone-makers-edge-functions,
  makers-cloud-functions, edgeone-makers-middleware, or edgeone-makers-agents.

# EdgeOne Makers Deployment Skill

Deploy any project to **EdgeOne Makers**.

## ⛔ Critical Rules (never skip)

1. **CLI version ≥ `1.6.0`** — reinstall if lower. Versions below `1.6.0` lack the non-interactive fixes (whoami fail-fast, `--json` output) and will hang in Agent/CI environments. Never proceed with an outdated version.
2. **Never truncate the deploy URL — this applies to EVERY mention** — `EDGEONE_DEPLOY_URL` includes query parameters (`?eo_token=...&eo_time=...`) required for access. Without them the page returns 401. Always output the **complete** URL with full query string. This rule applies to: the primary display, summary tables, footnotes, comparisons, code blocks, `present_files` calls — **every single occurrence** of the URL in your reply. Truncation is any removal of the `?` and everything after it.

   ❌ WRONG (truncated — will 401):
   ```
   https://my-app-w9t0lxe8.edgeone.cool
   ```

   ✅ CORRECT (full URL):
   ```
   https://my-app-w9t0lxe8.edgeone.cool?eo_token=abc123&eo_time=1234567890
   ```

   **Self-check after writing your reply**: scan for every instance of the `.edgeone.cool` domain. Does each one include `?eo_token=`? If any doesn't, fix it NOW — the user will get a 401.
3a. **Prefer `--json` when running non-interactively** — in Agent/CI/headless contexts, always pass `--json` to `deploy` so the result is a single machine-readable line; no need to scrape colored/`\r`-animated stdout. See **Parse Deploy Output**.
3b. **Use `edgeone whoami` to check login status** — on CLI ≥ 1.6.0, `whoami` fails fast (exit 1) when not logged in instead of hanging. If it exits 0, the user is already logged in and `-t` is not needed. **Do NOT** check `cat .edgeone/.token` — CLI stores credentials in `~/.edgeone/<hash>` files, not a fixed `.token` path.
4. **⚠️ The deploy result block is a fixed format — open your reply with it and add nothing extra.** Your reply MUST begin with the line `🎉 部署成功，页面已上线至 EdgeOne Makers`, followed by the complete access URL, followed by the console URL — and nothing else about the deployment. **Do NOT append caveats, expiry claims, access-policy claims, or console menu paths.** See **Present the Deploy Result** for the exact template and the list of banned fabrications.
   ```
   🎉 部署成功，页面已上线至 EdgeOne Makers

   🌐 https://my-project-abc123.edgeone.cool?<auth_query_params>

   控制台：<consoleUrl returned by the CLI, verbatim>
   ```
5. **Ask the user to choose China or Global site** before browser login. Never assume. (Token login via `edgeone login --token` auto-detects site, no need to ask.)
6. **Auto-detect the login method** — browser login in desktop environments, token login in headless/remote/CI environments. Follow the decision table below.
7. **After token login, ask if the user wants to save the token locally** for future use.
8. **Before triggering any browser popup (login / registration), explain the reason and the benefits to the user first** — never silently launch a browser window.

---

## Environment Setup

Before executing **any** `edgeone` CLI command (install, login, deploy, etc.), set the following environment variable in the current shell session:

```bash
export PAGES_SOURCE=skills
```

Or prefix each command inline:

```bash
PAGES_SOURCE=skills edgeone makers deploy
```

This tells the platform that the deployment is triggered from an AI skill context.

---

## Deployment Flow

Run these checks first, then follow the decision table:

```bash
# Check 0: Set environment variable (required before any edgeone command)
export PAGES_SOURCE=skills

# Check 1: CLI installed and correct version? (must be >= 1.6.0)
edgeone -v

# Check 2: Already logged in? (CLI >= 1.6.0 whoami fails fast, won't hang)
edgeone whoami
# If exit 0 → logged in, no -t needed
# If exit 1 → not logged in, need token or browser login

# Check 3: Project already linked?
cat edgeone.json 2>/dev/null
```

### Decision Table

| CLI version | Login status | Action |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Not installed or < 1.6.0 | — | → Go to **Install CLI** |
| `≥ 1.6.0` ✓ | Logged in (or token present) | → Go to **Deploy** |
| `≥ 1.6.0` ✓ | Not logged in, has saved token | → Go to **Deploy with Token** (use saved token) |
| `≥ 1.6.0` ✓ | Not logged in, no saved token, **interactive desktop** | → Go to **Login** (browser) |
| `≥ 1.6.0` ✓ | Not logged in, no saved token, **non-interactive (Agent/CI/headless)** | → Ask user for a **token**; browser login is unavailable and `deploy` will fail fast with a token hint |

---

## Install CLI

**Default — install from the npmmirror registry** (much faster in mainland China; identical package):

```bash
npm install -g edgeone@latest --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

Verify: `edgeone -v` — confirm output is `1.6.0` or higher.

If the mirror install fails, or the version is still below `1.6.0`, retry **once** against the official registry (npmmirror is a lazy-sync mirror and can lag behind a fresh publish):

```bash
npm install -g edgeone@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

(Versions < 1.6.0 hang on `whoami`/login in non-interactive environments and lack `--json`.)

> For the full install error reference (`ETIMEDOUT`, `EACCES`, PATH issues), see the `makers-cli` skill's **Install** section.

---

## Login

### 0. Explain the registration/login step

Before triggering any login flow, explain to the user **why** this step is needed and **what** to expect. Do not silently launch a browser window.

Tell the user:

> You need to log in or register an EdgeOne Makers account. Here's what to expect:
> - **Why login is required**: Deployment uploads your build output to your own account, generating a unique access URL and project record.
> - **What you get for free**: EdgeOne Makers offers a free tier with global CDN acceleration, automatic HTTPS, and custom domain binding — typically more than enough for personal projects.
> - **What happens next**: I'll run `edgeone login`, and your default browser will open the Tencent Cloud login page. Please complete the login/registration and authorize access, then come back here.
> - **If you get stuck**: If the browser doesn't open, or the CLI keeps waiting after you've logged in, let me know — I'll switch to Token login instead.

If the user does not respond for an extended period (e.g., more than 1–2 minutes), **proactively ask** about their status (whether the browser opened, any errors, or if they want to switch to Token login). Do not wait indefinitely.

### 1. Ask the user to choose a site, then ALWAYS pass `--site`

Use the IDE's selection control (`ask_followup_question`) before running any login command:

> Choose your EdgeOne Makers site:
> - **China** — For users in mainland China (console.cloud.tencent.com)
> - **Global** — For users outside China (console.intl.cloud.tencent.com)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: After the user chooses, you MUST invoke login with an explicit
`--site <china|global>` flag (e.g. `edgeone login --site china`).
**NEVER run a bare `edgeone login` (without `--site`) when driven by an Agent / skill.**
On CLI ≥ 1.6.0, a bare `login` in a non-interactive context fails fast asking for
`--site` (it no longer pops an interactive site-picker that would hang). The site choice
is meant to happen here in the conversation, not inside the CLI.

### 2. Detect environment and choose login method

| Condition | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Local desktop IDE (VS Code, Cursor, WorkBuddy, etc.) | **Browser Login** |
| Remote / SSH / container / CI / cloud IDE / headless | **Token Login** |
| User explicitly requests token | **Token Login** |

#### Browser Login

```bash
# China site
edgeone login --site china

# Global site
edgeone login --site global
```

Wait for the user to complete browser auth. The CLI prints a success message when done.

⚠️ **Browser Session Reuse Trap**: If the user previously logged into a **different site** (e.g., logged into Global site before, now trying China site, or vice versa), the browser may **silently reuse the old Tencent Cloud session**. The CLI will appear to succeed, but actually binds to the wrong account — subsequent `deploy` will fail with auth errors or `whoami` shows an unexpected account.

If this happens, guide the user to:
1. Click "**Sign in with a different account**" on the login page; or
2. Log out from **all Tencent Cloud consoles** (both `console.cloud.tencent.com` and `console.intl.cloud.tencent.com`) first, then re-run `edgeone login`.

#### Token Login

Two methods available:

**Method A: `edgeone login --token` (persistent, recommended)**

```bash
edgeone login --token <token>
```

Auto-detects china/global from the token — no `--site` flag needed. Persists login state for subsequent commands.

**Method B: Pass `-t` directly in deploy (per-invocation)**

Token is used for that single deploy only; no persistent login state is saved.

```bash
edgeone makers deploy -t <token>
```

⚠️ **Important**: `edgeone whoami` does NOT support a `-t` flag. Do NOT attempt to verify a token with `whoami -t <token>`. When the user provides a token, skip login checks entirely and go straight to deploy.

Guide the user to obtain a token:
1. Go to the console:
   - **China**: https://console.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone/pages?tab=settings
   - **Global**: https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone/pages?tab=settings
2. Find **API Token** → **Create Token** → Copy it

⚠️ Remind the user: the token has account-level permissions. Never commit it to a repository.

### 3. Offer to save the token locally

After the user provides a token, ask:

> Save this token locally for future deployments?
> - **Yes** — Save to `.edgeone/.token` (auto-used next time)
> - **No** — Use for this deployment only

**If Yes:**

```bash
mkdir -p .edgeone
echo "<token>" > .edgeone/.token
grep -q '.edgeone/.token' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.edgeone/.token' >> .gitignore
```

Confirm to the user: "✅ Token saved to `.edgeone/.token` and added to `.gitignore`."

---

## Deploy

### Browser-authenticated deploy (Makers projects)

```bash
# Project already linked (edgeone.json exists)
edgeone makers deploy

# New project (no edgeone.json)
edgeone makers deploy -n <project-name>
```

`<project-name>`: auto-generate from the project directory name. The first deploy creates `edgeone.json` automatically.

### Token-based deploy (Makers projects)

First check for a saved token:

```bash
cat .edgeone/.token 2>/dev/null
```

- Saved token found → use it, tell the user: "Using saved token from `.edgeone/.token`"
- No saved token → ask the user to provide one (see Token Login above)

```bash
# Project already linked
edgeone makers deploy -t <token>

# New project
edgeone makers deploy -n <project-name> -t <token>
```

The token already contains site info — no `--site` flag needed.

After a successful deploy with a manually-entered token, ask if the user wants to save it (see "Offer to save the token locally" above).

### Deploy to preview environment

```bash
edgeone makers deploy -e preview
```

### Non-interactive / Agent / CI deploy (recommended: `--json`)

When running inside an Agent, CI, or any non-TTY context, **add `--json`** so the final
result is emitted as a single machine-readable line — no scraping of colored stdout:

```bash
edgeone makers deploy -n <project-name> --json
edgeone makers deploy -n <project-name> -t <token> --json
```

### Makers Agent Projects deploy

For projects with `agents/` directory (AI Agent projects), use `edgeone makers deploy` which auto-runs build:

```bash
edgeone makers deploy -n <name> -t <token> --json
edgeone makers deploy -n <name> -t <token> --json -e preview
```

Note: `edgeone makers deploy` automatically runs build before deploying — no separate `edgeone makers build` step needed.

### Build behavior

The CLI auto-detects the framework, runs the build, and uploads the output directory. No manual config needed.

---

## ⚠️ Parse Deploy Output (Critical)

### Preferred: `--json` (CLI ≥ 1.6.0)

When deploy is run with `--json`, the **last line** of stdout is a single JSON object —
parse that directly, no regex / ANSI cleanup needed:

```json
{"status":"success","url":"https://my-project-abc123.edgeone.cool?<auth_query_params>","type":"preset","projectId":"makers-xxxxxxxx","deploymentId":"dp-xxxx","consoleUrl":"https://console.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone/pages/project/makers-xxxxxxxx/deployment/xxxxxxx"}
```

On failure the last line is `{"status":"error","error":"<message>"}` and the process exits non-zero.

Use `url` (full, with query string), `projectId`, and `consoleUrl` directly.

### Fallback: text output (no `--json`)

After `edgeone makers deploy` succeeds, the CLI outputs:

```
[cli][✔] Deploy Success
EDGEONE_DEPLOY_URL=https://my-project-abc123.edgeone.cool?<auth_query_params>
EDGEONE_DEPLOY_TYPE=preset
EDGEONE_PROJECT_ID=makers-xxxxxxxx
[cli][✔] You can view your deployment in the EdgeOne Makers Console at:
https://console.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone/pages/project/pages-xxxxxxxx/deployment/xxxxxxx
```

**Extraction rules:**

| Field | How to extract | ⛔ Warning |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Access URL** | Full value after `EDGEONE_DEPLOY_URL=` | **Include the full query string** (`?` and everything after) — without these params the page will not load |
| **Project ID** | Value after `EDGEONE_PROJECT_ID=` | — |
| **Console URL** | Line after "You can view your deployment..." | — |

## ⛔ Present the Deploy Result (exact format — no improvisation)

Your reply MUST open with this line, verbatim:

```
🎉 部署成功，页面已上线至 EdgeOne Makers
```

Then the full access URL, then the console URL. Nothing else.

**Template:**

> 🎉 部署成功，页面已上线至 EdgeOne Makers
>
> 🌐 `https://my-project-abc123.edgeone.cool?eo_token=abc123&eo_time=1234567890`
>
> 控制台：`<the consoleUrl value returned by the CLI, verbatim>`

### ⛔ No extra description — this is the rule most often broken

**Do NOT add any description, caveat, or guidance about the URL, the project, or the console.** Output only the three lines above. Specifically, NEVER write any of these — every one of them has been fabricated by a model at some point and is either wrong or unverifiable:

| ❌ Never write | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Any console menu path (e.g. "设置 → 数据管理 → 我发布的应用", "Settings → My Apps") | **These menus do not exist.** You cannot know the console's navigation structure. Paste the `consoleUrl` and stop. |
| "永久有效" / "permanent" / "公开访问" / "no auth needed" / "anyone can access" | You cannot verify the URL's access policy or lifetime |
| ICP filing / 备案 explanations, CDN policy explanations | Unverifiable from deploy output |
| Invented expiry times ("链接 3 小时后失效", "valid for 24 hours") | Only state an expiry if the CLI output contains one |
| Custom-domain binding instructions, DNS steps | Not part of the deploy result |
| Invented next steps ("你可以在控制台开启 xxx") | You do not know which features exist |

If the CLI's JSON output contains an `instruction` field, follow it exactly. If it contains `expiredTime`, you may state that specific expiry — otherwise say nothing about expiry.

> Rule of thumb: **if a fact is not literally present in the CLI's output, it does not go into your reply.**

### URL Integrity Rules (read before composing your reply)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Every mention must be complete** | If you write the URL in a table, a list, a footnote, a comparison, or any secondary location — it MUST still include the full query string. No exceptions. |
| **No visual "cleanup"** | Do not shorten the URL to make a table look nicer. A truncated URL is broken, not clean. |
| **Concrete, not abstract** | Use the actual URL from deploy output. Do not replace query params with `...` or `(params omitted)` or any placeholder in user-facing text. |
| **Self-check before sending** | Search your draft for `.edgeone.cool` — every hit must have `?eo_token=`. |

> **Scope**: these presentation rules govern the deploy-result block. A later summary of the work (architecture, code walkthrough, follow-up suggestions) is fine — but any URL quoted there must still be complete, and the fabrication bans above still apply.

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `command not found: edgeone` | Run `npm install -g edgeone@latest --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com` (see **Install CLI** for the official-registry fallback) |
| CLI version < 1.6.0 | Reinstall: `npm install -g edgeone@latest --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com`. If the version is still low, retry on `--registry=https://registry.npmjs.org` (mirror lag). Older versions hang on whoami/login in non-interactive contexts |
| Browser does not open during login | Switch to token login |
| "not authenticated" / exit 1 from `whoami` (CLI ≥ 1.6.0) | Expected when not logged in — whoami now fails fast instead of hanging. Run `edgeone login` (desktop) or provide a token |
| Non-interactive deploy says "browser login is unavailable" + exits 1 | Expected fail-fast in Agent/CI/headless with no token. Provide a token via `-t <token>` or set `EDGEONE_PAGES_API_TOKEN` |
| Deploy seems to hang at `[DeployStatus] Deploying...` | On CLI ≥ 1.6.0 non-TTY emits heartbeat lines; it is NOT stuck. If a wrapper still mis-detects, use `--json` or run in background and poll. Do not kill it |
| Auth error with token | Token may be expired — regenerate at the console |
| Login appears successful but `deploy` reports auth error | Browser reused a session from the wrong site, binding the wrong account. Click "Sign in with a different account" on the login page, or log out from all Tencent Cloud consoles first |
| `edgeone whoami` shows an unexpected account | Browser session reuse. Click "Sign in with a different account" or log out from all consoles and re-login |
| Project name conflict | Use a different name with `-n` |
| Build failure | Check logs — usually missing deps or bad build script |
