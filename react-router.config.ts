 * React Router v8 framework mode — static site generation.

 * per-locale language), producing static HTML in `build/client/`. We deploy only
 * `build/client/` to GitHub Pages; the server bundle stays unused.
 *
 * `ssr` is left enabled (the default) so route `loader`s are allowed — required
 * for data-driven prerendering. Setting `ssr: false` would forbid `loader`s.
